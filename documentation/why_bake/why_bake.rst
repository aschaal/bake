Why you should use bake
========================

Whether you should use bake is entirely up to you,
just take 2 minutes and have a look at our design goals and see if they fit what you are looking for.

Goal                                                                        Reasoning
=================================================================           ===============================================================================================
* It must be only a built tool                                              We want to focus your energy in providing a good and fast build tool.

* It must be a command line tool                                            Sticking to the unix and single purpose philosophy, we think proving a command line tool
                                                                            is the easiest way to be easily used and integrated with other tools. **IDE independence!**

* It must be easy to configure                                              We want the developer to be able to focus on coding and testing, not on reading and searching
                                                                            hours through the build tool documentation.
                                                                            **A build tool should be easy to use and not hard to maintain!**

* The configuration must not be a meta language                             We want our configurations to be WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get).
                                                                            We don't want developers to spend hours in searching for a configuration error
                                                                            where multiple other config and script generation steps are in between.

* The configurations of large projects must be easy to understand           In large projects, build configurations usually get pretty complex and big, therefore
                                                                            generally just a few people understand the build process. This makes the maintenance
                                                                            dependent on those people. This is a single point of failure and it should be avoided,
                                                                            in our opinion.

* It must be fast                                                           We personally aren't fans of waiting for the build. We rather build, test and then do a kicker
                                                                            break!

* It should be lightweight                                                  Lightweight here means: less dependencies, because dependencies can hinder people from getting their
                                                                            setup up and running.

* It must be easy to use different versions of the build tool               Sometimes it is necessary to break compatibility to embrace progress, even though
                                                                            it should be easy to switch between different versions of the tool.
