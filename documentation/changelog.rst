     * Bugfix: If a project is directly in the workspace root, it could not be referenced in Collection.meta. 

November 21, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.55.0
     * Added: default number of compiling threads is now equal to the number of logical processors instead of hardcoded 8 (only for Ruby >= 2.2).
     * Added: possibility to overwrite bake internal defaults for toolchain commands and flags
     * Bugfix: "remove" attribute of "Flags" now correctly supports regex 

November 4, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.54.3

October 14, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.54.1
    * Reverted: The change from 2.54: "(Windows only) If a case mismatch is detected between Files definition in Project.meta and filesystem, the compilation will be aborted."

    * Added: ArtifactExtension in Project.meta to configure the filename extension of the artifacts.
    * Added: Internal developer feature "-Z metadata=<json>" for MISRA tooling

    * Added: The filename for --dot can be omitted, default is <main config name>.dot in main project dir.
    * Added: --dot-project-level to write project-level-dependencies in dot files insted of config-level.

    * Bugfix: bakery regex did not take comments into account when parsing Project.meta.
    * Added: "strict" attribute to match only the specified Adapt config type.

    * Added: "Scope" as additional adapt conditions.
    * Added: all conditions like "toolchain" support list format, e.g. "GCC;CLANG".
    * Added: "compileOnly" annotation for "Files" which means that they shall be compiled, but not archived or linked (experimental feature, might be changed in future).
    * Added: improved GCC compiler error parser.
    * Cosmetic: when enforcing local paths e.g. for outputDir, "./" will be removed for nicer output.

March 25, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.51.2

March 21, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.51.1
    * Bugfix: under certain cases the same Adapt.meta could be found twice which results into a warning.
    * Changed: if a cmd of a Set (variable) returns with !=0, the output of cmd is now printed out to get an idea why it has failed.

March 13, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.51.0
    * Changed: refactored calculating include folders. Now it's much faster than before! However, the order of include folders may have changed for ambiguous configurations.
    * Changed: merge-include feature refactored after getting some feedback.

February 7, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.50.0
    * Added: command line option "--merge-inc" which copies all include files into one temprary folder and invokes the compiler with just one include path.
    * Added: command line option "--file-cmd" which writes all command line arguments into a file and hands it over to the compiler (with "@" in gcc and dcc).
    * Added: "adapt" supports now lists of projects/configs (additionally to wildcards), separated with ";".
    * Added: added Cuda support for GCC toolchain (experimental)

January 23, 2019 - bake-toolkit 2.49.0
    * Added: Support for IAR compiler.

November 28, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.48.3
    * Bugfix: Removed accidentally added debug output which was introduced in 2.48.2.

November 8, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.48.2
    * Bugfix: Now compatible with new QAC folder structure (problem was that user-suppressed warnings in qac.cct were not suppressed).

September 20, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.48.1
    * Bugfix: Compiler prefix change reverted for C and CPP, only assembler still has the new ASMCompilerPrefix.

September 7, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.48.0
    * Bugfix: Variables can be set to an empty string now
    * Added: Compiler prefix mechanism improved, see documentation

July 31, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.47.1
    * Bugfix: in same cases the OutputDir variables were not substituted correctly in 2.47.0.

July 27, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.47.0
    * Added: *Sleep*, *MakeDir*, *Remove*, *Copy* and *Move* commands in Project.meta.
    * Added: option -D to add defines via command line.
    * Added: DCC case check with --diab-case-check for Windows. Makes sense to start the compilation again after full build was successful with this parameter.
      With this parameter the code is not compiled, only checked. It takes around the time of a compilation. Note, with GCC the check is done during compilation in
      "no time" - enhancement request ticked filed at Windriver to make that possible with Diab.
    * Improved: Cyclic variable substitution
    * Removed: support of Visual Studio (not Visual Studio Code)
    * Removed: official support of Ruby 1.9
    * Bugfix: MapFile command now working for GCC

May 18, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.46.0
    * Added: Makefile command has new attribute **noClean**. If set to true, the target *clean* will not be executed when project is cleaned. Default: false.
    * Added: Makefile command has new attribute **changeWorkingDir**. If set to false, bake stays in project's directory instead of changing into makefile's directory. Default: true.
    * Added: Before executing the makefile, bake sets the environment variables $(BAKE_XX_COMMAND) and $(BAKE_XX_FLAGS), whereas XX is one of CPP, C, ASM, AR or LD.

May 4, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.45.0
    * Changed: it is possible now to specify adapt files directly with *--adapt <filename>*
    * Changed: variables can be set by calling a script (see *Set <var>, cmd: <script>*). If the script fails, bake aborts now with an error instead continuing with a warning.
    * Added: allow additional bake arguments specified per project in a bakery collection
    * Bugfix: bakery collections can now reference a quoted project name and names with "-" or ":"
    * Bugfix: under rare circumstances bake did not abort with an error if the main directory specified with -m does not exist

March 22, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.44.1
    * Bugfix: in Adapt.meta "__MAIN__" in project now applies to *all* configs in the main project
    * Changed: "--compilation-db" now generates absolute paths if "--abs-paths" is set

February 26, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.44.0
    * Added: Case sensitivity check of C/C++ include files (on by default!), use --no-case-check to disable it
    * Added: Variable $(Uid), a CRC32 over relative path to main project dir plus main config name.

February 12, 2018 - bake-toolkit 2.43.0
    * Bugfix: when building with "stop on first error" (-r) and an error occurs in PreSteps or PostSteps of a dependency, the error status was not correctly handled.
    * Added: option to keep file endings for object files, which means file.cpp becomes file.cpp.o instead of file.o:

      .. code-block:: console

          DefaultToolchain keepObjFileEndings: true

    * Added: the hard coded list for source file endings for a specific compiler (CPP, C, ASM) can now be overwritten, e.g.:

      .. code-block:: console

          Compiler CPP {
              SrcFileEndings ".cpp, .c, .cxx"
          }

May 29, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.37.4
    * Changed: bakeqac: timeout for *qacli* calls now 80% of qacretry time (except *qacli admin*, which is 60 seconds).

March 27, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.35.0
    * Bugfix: Rubys IO.select() is not thread-safe by itself. It could happen, that bake hangs and the user has to press a key (due to waiting for already closed stdin stream) - affected versions: >= 2.33.0.
    * Bugfix: if no roots.bake was found, the default root ("<mainProject>/..") was added to the root list even when -w options were added on command line - affected versions: >= 2.26.0.
    * Added: roots defined on command line (with -w) and entries in roots.bake can be equipped with an optional search depth setting, e.g. "-w some/folder,3".
      This can reduce startup time of bake avoid multiple-projects-found-warnings.

March 16, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.34.4
    * Added: CommandLine and Makefile have a new argument. If *independent: true*, they are not executed exclusively but in parallel to other projects/configs.
    * Added: -j can now be used without space and -v with space, e.g. -j8 or -j 8, -v2 or -v 2.

    * Changed: Projects are built in parallel now (not only the files within a single project). This implies a change in the output.

February 27, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.32.0
    * Changed: Per default configs without *Files* and *Steps* are not counted and printed out anymore (because nothing has to be done), use *-v2* to show them again.
    * Changed: Templates used for *--create* are now closer to ESRLabs standard. Exit code corrected (was 1 instead of 0), thanks to flxo for the pull request.
    * Changed: Promoted warning "files are compiled more than once" to error.

February 23, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.31.5
    * Added: qac: Retry if QAX daemon cannot be reached

    * Added: "If" is now an alias for "Adapt". To negate the conditions, use "Unless".
    * Added: For Adapts in Project.meta the "project" attribute is now "__THIS__" per default, which should be correct in almost every case.
    * Cosmetic: Getting rid of warning output if paths start with ".", e.g. IncludeDir "./local/abc".
    * Cosmetic: Only print the first out-of-date meta file when checking cache.

January 20, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.30.0
    * Added: New adapt option "push_front".
    * Added: Project.meta and Collection.meta will be searched upwards if not found in current directory (or the directory specified with -m).
    * Changed: --doc opens online docu per default. You can install the offline docu with --install-doc.
    * Added: --debug prints more information when reading the cache, use this as feedback if you think caching does not work correctly.

January 12, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.29.4
    * Added: qac: Workaround if QAC cannot handle the amount of errors and returns with != 0. The build must not be aborted, instead the printed errors should be parsed.

January 12, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.29.3
    * Bugfix: qac: QAC bails out if modules have too many errors, added workaround and additional hint in output.

January 11, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.29.3
    * Bugfix: Some commandline checks in combination with --file-list were outdated.

January 10, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.29.2
    * Changed: --file-list output now written into files instead of stdout, see "bake -h".
    * Bugfix: adapt condition "toolchain" not evaluated correctly in all cases

January 4, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.29.0
    * Added: CleanSteps, executed only when calling bake with "-c" or "--rebuild".
    * Added: Wildcard "*" is allowed for project/config names in Adapt.
    * Bugfix: In certain circumstances an Adapt was not applied to subconfigs of the Project.meta where Adapt was defined.

January 4, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.28.1
    * Bugfix: Build does not break anymore if "LintPolicy" is still defined in Project.meta. Now only a warning is printed out.

January 3, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.28.0
    * Added: private flag for configs (cannot be referenced directly from outside of the project).
    * Added: attribute "echo: off" for CommandLine and Makefile.
    * Added: "--file-list" shows all files and headers of the projects.

    * Changed: qac: again slightly modified cip workaround.

January 2, 2017 - bake-toolkit 2.27.0
    * Added: local *Adapt* with conditions (e.g. toolchain), see :ref:`adapt_reference`.
    * Changed: qac: cip workaround slightly adapted, removed temporary debug output.

December 23, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.26.1
    * Changed: qac: next try to add a workaround for the cip file bug.
    * Cosmetic: fixed possible wrong message when reloading metas ("corrupt" instead of "changed")

December 20, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.26.0
    * Changed: before this version, "-w" command line args (which define the workspace roots) have overwritten roots.bake file. Now these roots will be
      merged. First "-w", then roots.bake. Note: this will not break current builds.

December 16, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.25.1
    * Bugfix: a null pointer exception could occur in 2.25.0, which happened in a complex scenario with multiple dependencies to a default config which extends another config with dependencies.
      Luckily, this bugfix goes along with a small performance improvement when loading uncached meta files.

December 15, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.25.0
    * Changed (!): before this version, all "IncludeDir"s were evaluated prior to the "Dependency"s to calculate the include path string for the compiler. Now the line order
      is taken into account. To get the same include path string as in 2.24.x, shift all "IncludeDir"s in front of the first "Dependency".
    * Added: it is possible to mark an IncludeDir with "system: true", which means that e.g. for gcc "-isystem" is used instead of "-I". Very useful for third party libs.
    * Bugfix: qac: adapted parser to new gcc version strings. On some machines an incorrect CCT was chosen.
    * Bugfix: when building with "-p <projectname>", bake has not only built <projectname>, but also all injected dependencies of <projectname>, which was not intended.
    * Added: qac: additional step to generate reports, activate it manually with "--qacstep report", see documentation.
    * Cosmetic: Adapt.meta files are also cached now.
    * Temporary: cip bug workaround from 2.24.2 does not work, added some debug output to get more infos - sorry for the spam - will be removed soon.

December 5, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.24.3
    * Added: qac: if "<mainConfigName>Qac" is found in main project, it will be used instead of "<mainConfigName>"
    * Added: First version of bake-format script, thanks to gizmomogwai

November 24, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.24.2
    * Bugfix: qac: fixed recognition of platform for cygwin with gcc >= 5.0
    * Bugfix: qac: default folder of qacdata is now <main project>/.qacdata instead of <working dir>/.qacdata
    * Bugfix: qac: workaround for "qacli admin": retry up to 10 times if cip file is empty (getting compiler data)

November 16, 2016 - bake-toolkit 2.24.1
    * Bugfix: qac.cct was not appended if --cct is used.

January 7, 2015 - bake-toolkit 2.0.3
    * Changed: default configuration is chosen if configuration name is omitted. This applies to command line as well as to Dependency definitions, e.g.:
        * Project.meta

            .. code-block:: console

                Dependency canDriver        # no config attribute

        * Command line

            .. code-block:: console

                User@Host:~$ bake -m bla/myProj

        .. note::

            To show the possible configs of a project, use the `--show_configs` command line option.


    * Changed: more than one config of a project can be used in one build.

        Example:

        .. code-block:: console

            Dependency canDriver, config: C1
            Dependency canDriver, config: C2


        To reference a config of the current project, omit the project name, e.g.:

        .. code-block:: console

            Dependency config: C3

        To build a single project, you can still use -p command line argument:

        .. code-block:: console

            User@Host:~$ bake Debug -p canDriver

        However, if canDriver has more than one config in the workspace, all configs will be built. To build only a single config, use a comma separator like this:

        .. code-block:: console

            User@Host:~$ bake Debug -p canDriver,C1

    * Changed: the default output folder has been changed due to the new feature of having several configs of a project in one workspace.

            This refers to the old output directory. Change it or if you want to support old and new bake versions,
            write a PreStep which copies the file from the new location to the old one.

    * Added: --docu option. Specify the docu command line in Docu tag of the (Default)Toolchain.
    * Removed: support for Ruby 1.8. Use Ruby 1.9 or higher.
    * Removed: dependencies to cxxproject and rake gems
    * Removed: "-j" as default flag when calling makefiles. This must be explicitly specified.
